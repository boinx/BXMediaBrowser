// To access the real media file from a (sandboxed) host application, you cannot use the location or URL property
// of IMBObject. First, the object might not represent a local file, but a remote resource (e.g. on the internet)
// that needs to be downloaded first. And second, if your host app is sandboxed, having the NSURL to a local file
// would not do you any good, as your app wouldn't be allowed to access this file. 

// Instead use the methods below to request a bookmark. This is an asynchronous operation (which also automatically 
// downloads any remote resources to your harddisk). When you receive the bookmark in the completion block and 
// resolve it to a NSURL, the PowerBox authorized your app to access this file for the current launch session.
// In that respect it acts similarly to NSOpenPanel or drag & drop from the Finder.
