#pragma mark ABSTRACT

// This is the designated object view controller class for any icon view that wants to expose
// skimmable images (like iPhoto events). You may subclass (see IMBiPhotoEventObjectViewController
// for an example).
//
// Since this controller class is a "custom object view controller" class in terms of iMedia
// do NOT store it in the array of the panel controller where the other object view controllers
// are reused from (one per media type), because then we would have two controllers in there
// for the same media type "image".

@interface IMBSkimmableObjectViewController : IMBObjectViewController {

	NSUInteger _previousNodeObjectIndex;	// Index of node object the mouse was over on last mouse move
	NSUInteger _previousImageIndex;			// Index of image in node object that was last displayed when skimming
	NSDictionary* _userInfo;
}
